# Changelog

Notable changes per release. plMail runs its migrations automatically on boot,
so anything that changes the schema irreversibly is called out explicitly.

The published image tags: `latest` follows the most recent release below,
`main` follows the tip of the default branch, and `sha-…` pins one commit.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Snooze.** Put a conversation away and have it come back later — from the
  message row, the list toolbar, or a JMAP client via the `Thread/set`
  extension. Snoozed conversations get their own sidebar entry and view.
  `app:mail:wake-snoozed` runs every minute to bring them back.
- **JMAP draft attachments.** `Email/set` now accepts uploaded blobs in
  `attachments`, per RFC 8621; drafts created over JMAP previously dropped them
  silently.
- **Login throttling.** Five attempts per account per fifteen minutes on the
  password form, and a separate limit on the two-factor code form — which the
  firewall's throttling does not cover, and which is the form an attacker
  reaches holding a stolen password.
- **Admin user management.** plMail's data model has always been multi-user, but
  there was no way to create the second user: the setup wizard and `app:setup`
  both make the first one and then refuse. Admin → Users adds, edits, promotes
  and removes people. An administrator deliberately cannot change an existing
  user's password or remove anyone's second factor — both would make an admin
  session a way into someone else's mailbox.
- **PHPStan** at level 5, with a baseline, in CI. **Dependabot** for composer,
  npm and GitHub Actions.
- **LICENSE.** The project has always said AGPL-3.0 in its README; the licence
  text is now actually distributed with it, and `composer.json` no longer
  contradicts it by claiming "proprietary".

### Fixed

- **Snoozing from the web UI did nothing but set a timer.** No labels moved and
  nothing propagated, so the conversation stayed in the inbox — locally and at
  the provider — while its row vanished from the list. The sweep would then
  "wake" a thread that had never left.
- **The snooze button on a message row cleared a snooze instead of setting
  one**, and the toolbar's snoozed everything to a hardcoded 8am tomorrow.
- **"Test connection" in account settings crashed** with an `ArgumentCountError`
  whenever the form was incomplete or the password blank — the two cases it
  exists to report.
- **The admin Graph category sync caught an exception class that does not
  exist**, so Graph failures propagated instead of degrading quietly.
- **User search in the admin area returned everything**, and soft-deleted users
  were visible to every query that claimed to exclude them. Both were the same
  mistake: a Doctrine expression built and never passed to `andWhere()`.
- **JMAP `Email/set` rejected valid mailbox patches.** Current `mailboxIds` were
  emitted as label ids where the protocol expects per-account binding ids; since
  both are autoincrement ints, a patch removing one mailbox failed with "No such
  Mailbox".

### Changed

- `latest` is published from release tags only. It previously followed every
  push to `main`, which meant the tag the README tells people to pull could
  carry unreviewed work and automatic schema migrations.
- The login form no longer shows a "forgot password?" link. There is no reset
  flow — recovery is a console command — and the link was an `href="#"` that did
  nothing.
