/**
 * The pictures beside highlighted entries in What's new (#165).
 *
 * A highlight in CHANGELOG.md may name a screenshot —
 * `<!-- highlight screenshot=pull-to-sync -->` — and the dialog shows
 * public/whats-new/pull-to-sync.png beside it. Each picture is taken here,
 * against the demo mailbox, by the pull request that adds the feature: one
 * test per name, named as the file is. ChangelogReaderTest fails while a
 * highlight names a picture that does not exist.
 *
 * Opt-in, like the README's pictures, and run by the same command, whose
 * filter matches this file too:
 *
 *   npm run test:e2e:screenshots
 *
 * By name, not by release: the pull request does not know which release it
 * will ship in, and a picture is of a feature, which outlives the release.
